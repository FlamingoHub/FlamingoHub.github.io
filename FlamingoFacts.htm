    <h2>  <strong>  <font size="+5">  Why are Flamingos pink?    </font>
       </strong></h2>
    <font size="+2">
      The answer to this question is still not fully understood, but there are a few possible explanations. One theory is that the pink color comes from the food that flamingoes eat. They mostly eat small shrimp-like creatures called brine shrimp. These shrimp contain a pink pigment called astaxanthin, which is thought to be transferred to the flamingoes when they eat them. Another possibility is that the flamingo's feathers contain a pink pigment called carotenoids. These pigments are found in a variety of foods, including carrots and tomatoes. It is possible that the flamingoes are pink because they eat a lot of carotenoid-rich foods..</font>
